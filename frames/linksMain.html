	We thought the idea of using color cards to categorize movies was a really interesting and creative way to do it. 
A color card is a card used to label and classify colors. <br>
It contains a variety of colors and is commonly used in fields such as painting, design, visual arts, and photography.
Using color cards to categorize movies makes them more systematic and easy to understand. Here are some ideas for possible use of color cards to categorize movies:<br><br>
	<b>Color theme:</b> Use different colors in the color card to represent different themes of the movie, such as love, horror, science fiction, comedy, etc. 
This makes it easier for the audience to understand and classify the films.<br><br>
	<b>Director's style:</b> The use of color cards to represent the director's personal style, such as the director's color to represent their shooting style, composition skills, etc. 
This allows the audience to better understand the director's shooting style and techniques.<br><br>
	<b>Theme emotion:</b> Color cards are used to represent the theme and emotion of the movie.<br> 
For example, the color of the movie represents the emotion expressed in the movie, such as anger, sadness, happiness, etc. 
This allows the audience to better understand the emotions and themes expressed in the film.<br><br>
	All in all, using color cards to categorize movies is a very interesting and creative way to make movies more systematic and easy to understand, 
as well as allowing the audience to better understand the different aspects and characteristics of the movies. </p>
